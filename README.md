# 2D-plotter
To create a 2D plotting machine which can generate a binary image on a paper using a stylus.

# Objectives

- [ ] extract coordinates of pixels from a binary image
- [ ] map out the points to real-life-size paper dimensions (in cm)
- [ ] insert the points into a readable file format for the arduino
- [ ] create a arduino program to control the motors to move the stylus
- [ ] create a 3D CAD file of the 2D Plotter machine
